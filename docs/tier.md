Part 1: For Your Users (The Creators)
Your users are creators. They pour time and money into their cars and want to know if their creations are being appreciated. They need data that is personal, immediate, and actionable for them.

The Goal: To give users insights into how their specific profile and cars are performing.

The Best Tool: Your existing custom Convex analytics system. It is perfectly designed for this. Using Google Analytics here would be a mistake because it's not real-time, and it's incredibly difficult to securely separate one user's data from another's. Your current system is secure and fast.

What Data I Would Show Users (Tiered by Subscription):

Free Tier (The Hook):
Total Views: A simple, combined count of profile views and car views. This is the basic "vanity metric" that gets users excited.
Last 7 Days of Activity: A simple line chart showing views over the past week to encourage daily check-ins.
Starter Tier (The Engager):
Views Breakdown: Separate counts for Profile Views vs. Total Car Views.
Top 3 Cars: A list of their most-viewed cars. This helps them understand what content is popular.
Product Link Clicks: A total count of how many times visitors have clicked their affiliate/product links. This is a crucial metric for users who want to monetize.
Pro Tier (The Power User):
Audience Insights:
Referral Sources: Where are your visitors coming from? (e.g., Instagram, a forum, direct link). This is super valuable for them to know where to promote their profile.
Geographic Breakdown: A map or list showing which countries/cities their views are coming from.
Detailed Content Performance:
View counts for every car.
Click counts for every product link. This helps them optimize their parts list.
Custom Date Ranges: Allow them to see performance for any time period they choose.
This tiered approach gives users a reason to upgrade and directly connects the features to the value they receive.

Part 2: For You (The Developer)
Your goal is different. You need to understand the health of the entire application, how to grow it, and where to invest your time.

The Goal: To get a high-level overview of application performance, user acquisition, and engagement funnels.

The Best Tool: Google Analytics (GA4). It is the industry standard and is built to answer exactly these questions.

What Data I Would Want to See in Google Analytics:

Acquisition:
Traffic Sources: How are people discovering Carfolio in the first place? (Google search, social media, etc.)
New vs. Returning Users: Is the user base growing and are people coming back?
Engagement:
Daily & Monthly Active Users (DAU/MAU): The core metric for app health.
Most Visited Pages: Are people just looking at profiles, or are they using the "Add Car" and "Edit Profile" features?
Average Session Duration: How long do people spend on the site?
Conversion (Key Business Metrics):
Sign-Up Rate: What percentage of visitors create an account?
Subscription Funnel:
How many users view the "Go Pro" page?
How many click the "Upgrade" button?
How many successfully complete a payment? (This requires tracking events).
Feature Adoption: How many users have added more than one car? How many have added more than 5 parts?
Summary of the Plan
For Users: We will enhance your existing Convex analytics system. It's the right tool for the job. We'll focus on providing tiered, valuable, and personal data.
For You: We will integrate Google Analytics to track overall app health and business metrics. This will be for your eyes only.
This hybrid approach ensures you aren't trying to force one tool to do a job it wasn't designed for. It gives you powerful, developer-focused insights while providing your users with a fast, secure, and valuable feature that makes them love your platform.

What do you think? If you agree with this strategy, I'll update our plan, and we can begin by setting up Google Analytics.
